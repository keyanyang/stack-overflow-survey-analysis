## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

When it comes to the morning routine, everyone has their own preference. Some wake up at 5 AM, feed the dog, review Hacker News and go to work. Some get up at 8:55 and join the Zoom meeting at 9 without webcam open.

I found a survey conducted by Stack Overflow in 2018 showing the wake time of respondents. Coming up with a few questions, I want to search for some interesting insights by answering them.

1. In which country do developers get up early?
2. Do people using different programming languages wake up at different times?
3. Does wake up time have an effect on job satisfaction?
4. Do people getting up at different times earn different?


## File Descriptions<a name="files"></a>

There is one iPython notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The Data folder contains the survey data used by this analysis.
